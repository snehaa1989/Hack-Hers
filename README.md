## Motivation
So, you may have had PCOS for a while. And you may have tried so many times to eat the way that you know you should.

To exercise like you know you should.

The problem is that you start off so well but as the days go by, you find your motivation starts to wane.

You sneak in some junk food on the side.

You start to miss that gym session.

And before you know it, you are right back to where you started.

And your PCOS symptoms come back with a vengeance.
for Millions of women suffering from PCOS/PCOD, sometimes its just so hard to stay motivated. To keep doing what you know you should be doing.
And we get that. In an attempt to make Women, and society in general, aware about PCOS/PCOD, we have come up with this app, Pcod-helper. We aim to make life easier for women who feel that they cannot do anything about this condition, We hope this app will help them in any way possible.
